### Do I need to concern myself with everything that is in this repository?

Such as package.json, service worker stuff and all the configurations? Not really - the Javascript
files are the ones you will be working with (and maybe CSS, depending on how much you are into
styling). This is a skeleton configuration that is indicative of how modern web projects are set
up nowadays, and learning at some point what all the bits and pieces do is important, but not the
core of this exercise.
